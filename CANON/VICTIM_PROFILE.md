**Occupation:** Failed novelist / Substitute English teacher

## Archetype
**Primary:** The Wannabe

**Secondary traits:** Conspiracy theorist lite, amateur people-watcher, perpetual underdog with delusions of grandeur

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Romantic delusion

**How it manifests:**
- Takes photos of "suspicious" people he imagines are spies
- Keeps a leather-bound "observation journal"
- Follows strangers who seem "interesting"
- Dramatically narrates his own life in third person internally

**How it kills them:**
His obsessive documentation of a real intelligence operation leads operatives to eliminate him as a potential leak, even though his "spy notes" are hilariously inaccurate.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'9", soft middle-aged spread, stooped shoulders
- **Hair:** Thinning brown, unconvincing combover
- **Distinguishing features:** Constantly squinting, round wire-rimmed glasses, permanent five o'clock shadow
- **Typical outfit:** Beige trench coat (even in summer), messenger bag bulging with notebooks, vintage film camera around neck

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Observant - becomes obsessive surveillance of strangers
2. Creative imagination - becomes inability to distinguish fantasy from reality

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Arrogance about his "perceptive abilities" - leads to ignoring actual danger
2. Need for validation - leads to sharing his "discoveries" too publicly

### Pet Peeves
- People who don't "pay attention" to their surroundings
- Modern smartphones replacing "real" cameras

### Fears
- Surface fear: Dying before finishing his "masterpiece" novel
- Deeper fear: Being ordinary, having lived an unremarkable life

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in a dreary suburb of Birmingham, raised by a librarian mother who encouraged his reading. His father was a postal worker who died young of a heart attack. Gerry has been writing the same spy novel for twenty-three years, rewriting chapter one endlessly. He teaches Year 7 English at a comprehensive school where students mock him openly.

### Why They Travel
Finally taking his "research trip" after inheriting 8,000 pounds from a distant aunt. Convinced he needs to see the Cold War cities to make his novel authentic. Secretly hopes something interesting will happen to him.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Chose this Prague hostel specifically because of a TripAdvisor review mentioning it was in a "sketchy neighborhood with interesting characters." He thought it would provide material.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "operative," "tradecraft," "dead drop," "surveillance," "asset"
- Avoids words like: "coincidence" - everything is connected
- Catchphrases: "Now that's curious..." / "Just like in my novel..."

### Speech Pattern
- Speaks in hushed, conspiratorial tones even ordering breakfast
- Pauses dramatically before making ordinary observations
- British formal, slightly pompous

### Internal Monologue Style
Narrates his own life like a spy thriller: "Gerald sensed something was wrong. The man in the corner had ordered black coffee twice..."

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Twitter/X (for sharing conspiracy threads)
- **Follower count:** 234 (mostly bots)
- **Posting style:** Thread-heavy analysis of "suspicious" news events
- **Last post before death:** Photo of hostel common room with caption "The players are gathering. Some of these people are NOT who they claim to be. #Prague #SpyCity"

### Online vs Reality
Presents himself as a seasoned observer of the shadow world. Reality: hasn't left England in 15 years before this trip.

## Relationships

### Family
- Divorced, no children. Ex-wife left after year three of "the novel"

### Friends
- One friend from a spy fiction writing forum who he's never met in person

### Romantic
- Harbors a fantasy that he'll meet a femme fatale on this trip

### At the Hostel
- Creeps out younger travelers with intense staring
- Attempts to recruit a Dutch backpacker as his "temporary partner"
- Makes staff uncomfortable with questions about "the previous owners"

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Spends hours in the common room pretending to read while photographing two men having a quiet conversation in Russian.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Writing in his observation journal, smugly adding "confirmation" that he's uncovered an SVR operation. He has no idea what SVR actually stands for.

### Final Thoughts
"Finally. Something real. My novel will write itself now. They'll see. They'll all see how brilliant I am—"

### Last Words
"Wait, I can explain—I'm just a writer—"
