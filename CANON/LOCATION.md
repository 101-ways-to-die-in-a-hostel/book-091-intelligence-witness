## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Marek
**Description:** Late 20s Czech, shaved head, neck tattoos, surprisingly friendly. Former metal band member. Works nights.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - headphones in, watching Netflix behind desk

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Hana | Elderly, speaks no English, cleans thoroughly, found the body |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | N/A | Self-service kitchen |
| Manager | Jakub | Rarely present, handles police interaction, wants case closed quickly |

### Staff Knowledge
No staff awareness of intelligence activity. Marek noticed "businessmen" types occasionally but assumed corporate travelers slumming it. Previous strange incidents chalked up to "weird backpackers."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Quiet, recovering. Travelers nursing hangovers or planning day trips. Kitchen busy around noon. Common room has travelers reading or on laptops.

### Night Vibe
Pre-game drinking in common room. Groups leaving for Old Town bars. After midnight, stumbling returns. Loud whispered conversations in dorms. The building settles and creaks.

### Guest Demographics
70% under 30, mixed nationalities (Americans, Australians, Germans, British most common). Some older travelers like Gerry (viewed with suspicion). Occasional lone travelers who don't interact.

### Reputation
Online reviews: "Basic but cheap!" "Good location for bar crawl." "Showers sometimes cold." "Weird guy in trench coat kept photographing people (1 star)."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Tram from main train station (25 minutes). Some arrive by bus from Vienna or Berlin. Uber/Bolt common. Building hard to find (down an alley, easy to miss).

### Check-in Process
Passport scanned, credit card on file, wristband issued (room key is physical, old-fashioned). 10pm quiet hours explained (never enforced).

### Rules
No outside guests after 11pm (ignored), no smoking inside (ignored), quiet hours 10pm-8am (laughable)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: slow but functional)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers (small, bring own lock)
- [x] Laundry
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [x] Rooftop
- [x] Tours offered (via partner agency, walking tours)
- [x] Other: Book exchange shelf where Gerry found le Carre novels

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Prague's backpacker scene is accurately depicted. The city's Cold War espionage history is real (significant intelligence activity 1945-1989 and continuing). Location of hostel is fictional but plausible for Zizkov/Vinohrady border area.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Avoid Cold War stereotypes. Czech people are not "former communists" - they were occupied. Don't mock the language or culture.
